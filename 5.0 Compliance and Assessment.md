# 5.0 Compliance and Assessment 

## Privacy vs. Security

+ Privacy is a data governance requirement that arises when collecting and processing personal data.
+ Security controls focus on the CIA attributes of the processing system, privacy requires policies to identify private data, ensure that storage, processing, and retention is compliant with relevant regulations, limit access to the private data to authorized persons only, and ensure the rights of data subjects to review and remove any information held about them are met.

+ Legal Requirements
   + Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)
   + Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)
   + Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)
   + General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
   + California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA)
   + The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
   + The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)

## Controls

+ Cybersecurity refers to the protection of personal or organizational information or information resources from unauthorized access, attacks, theft, or data damage over computer or electronic systems and networks
+ A cybersecurity analyst is a senior position within an organization's security team responsible for protecting sensitive information and preventing unauthorized access to electronic data and systems
+ The duties of a cybersecurity analyst may include implementing and configuring security controls, managing security incidents, performing risk assessments and penetration tests, and maintaining threat intelligence
+ Successful analysts should have technical knowledge, problem-solving skills, attention to detail, patience, and calm decision-making abilities
+ Cybersecurity analysts may work in a security operations center (SOC), which is a location where security professionals monitor and protect critical information assets in an organization
+ Security controls are measures designed to give an asset or information system confidentiality, integrity, availability, and nonrepudiation
+ Security controls should be selected and deployed in a structured way within an overall risk management framework and classified according to their category and function
+ Common categories of security controls include preventive, detective, corrective, deterrent, and compensating controls
+ Security controls should be chosen based on their effectiveness, cost, and feasibility in a particular organization's environment.


## Non-Technical Controls

+ Classification and Confidentiality
   + Data classification is a tag or label that shows how confidential it is. Data confidentiality can be divided into several levels, following military usage:
      + Unclassified (public)
      + Classified (private/internal use only/official use only)
      + Confidential (or restricted)
      + Secret
      + Top-Secret
  
+ Data Types and Privacy
   + Data can also be tagged as a particular type. The data type is important in terms of evaluating privacy as well as security requirements

+ Purpose Limitation
   + Privacy regulations such as GDPR stipulate that data can only be collected for a defined purpose, for which the data subject must give explicit consent. Data collected under that consent statement cannot then be used for any other purpose.

+ Data Minimization
   + Data minimization is the principle that data should only be processed and stored if that is necessary to perform the purpose for which it is collected.

+ Data Sovereignty
   + Data sovereignty refers to a jurisdiction preventing or restricting processing and storage from taking place on systems do not physically reside within that jurisdiction.

+ Retention Policies
   + A set of policies, procedures, and tools for managing the storage of persistent data.
   
+ Retention Standards
   + To meet compliance and e-discovery requirements, organizations may be legally bound to retain certain types of data for a specified period.
   
+ Ownership (Roles)
   + Data owner — A senior (executive) role with ultimate responsibility for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information asset.
   + Data steward — This role is primarily responsible for data quality.
   + Data custodian — This role handles managing the system on which the data assets are stored.
   + Privacy officer — This role is responsible for oversight of any PII/SPI/PHI assets managed by the company.

+ Data Sharing & Privacy Agreements
   + Non-disclosure agreement (NDA)
   + Interconnection security agreement (ISA) 
   + Service level agreement (SLA)
   + Data sharing and use agreement

## Technical Controls

+ Access controls are used to secure data and software resources, and can be applied to file systems, databases, and other types of resources
+ Access control lists (ACLs) contain a list of accounts (principals) allowed to access a resource and the permissions they have over it
+ Different policies can be applied to different statements (e.g. SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) in a database
+ Geographic access requirements can include data sovereignty considerations (e.g. where data is stored) and employee access from multiple locations
+ Encryption helps to mitigate the risk of access controls being circumvented or compromised
+ Data can be in different states: at rest (persistent storage media), in transit (transmitted over a network), or in use (volatile memory)
+ Data loss prevention (DLP) products help to discover, classify, and prevent unauthorized access to data
+ Identity and access management (IAM) involves managing the identities of users and granting them access to resources based on their roles
+ Logging and monitoring systems can help to track activity on a network or system, and alert administrators to potential security issues
+ Large datasets containing PII or PHI may be shared or sold between organizations, and steps can be taken to remove personal or identifying information from these datasets to reduce compliance risk when storing data
+ Deidentification methods can be used to remove personal data that is collected to perform a transaction but does not need to be retained afterward
+ Data masking involves substituting all or part of the contents of a field with a placeholder, such as "x", and is irreversible
+ Tokenization involves replacing all or part of the data in a field with a randomly generated token, which is stored with the original value on a separate server or vault and can be reversible
+ Aggregation/banding involves generalizing the data, such as substituting a specific age with a broader age band
+ Reidentification is the process of combining a deidentified dataset with other data sources to discover how secure the deidentification method used is
+ K-anonymous information is data that can be linked to 2 or more individuals and carries a risk of reidentification
+ Digital rights management (DRM) is a set of technologies that aim to prevent unauthorized distribution of content by requiring authorized devices or software to access it
+ Watermarking involves adding a hidden, identifying mark to a digital file to trace it back to its source if it is distributed without permission

## Risk

+ Enterprise risk management (ERM) is the process of evaluating, measuring, and mitigating risks in an organization.
+ NIST's Managing Information Security Risk publication recommends a four-step process for risk management: framing the risk management strategy, assessing risks, responding to identified risks, and monitoring the effectiveness of risk response measures.
+ Risk identification is a part of the assess step and involves evaluating threats, identifying vulnerabilities, and determining the probability and impact of an event on an asset or process.
+ A systems assessment process involves identifying and prioritizing the critical systems that support the organization's mission essential functions (MEFs), as well as inventorying the people, tangible assets, intangible assets, and procedures that support these functions.

## Calculating Risk

+ Risk calculation is the process of determining the probability and impact of a threat scenario to assess the overall risk.
+ Risk is calculated by multiplying probability and magnitude.
+ There are three methods for calculating risk: quantitative, qualitative, and semi-quantitative.
+ In a quantitative risk calculation, probability is expressed as a percentage and magnitude as a cost value. The single loss expectancy (SLE) is the expected financial loss from a specific event, and the annual loss expectancy (ALE) is the SLE multiplied by the annual rate of occurrence.
+ In a qualitative risk calculation, people's opinions are used to determine the likelihood and impact of risk factors, often using simple labels or categories.
+ In a semi-quantitative risk calculation, a hybrid method is used to find a middle ground between purely quantitative and qualitative methods.

## Analyzing Risk

+ Business impact analysis (BIA) is the process of assessing the potential losses from different threat scenarios, which can be grouped into categories such as impacts on life and safety, finance and reputation, and privacy.
+ BIA is governed by metrics that express system availability, including:
   + Maximum tolerable downtime (MTD): the longest period that a business function outage can occur without causing irrecoverable business failure
   + Recovery time objective (RTO): the period following a disaster that an IT system may remain offline
   + Work recovery time (WRT): the time following systems recovery when there may be added work to reintegrate different systems and test overall functionality
   + Recovery point objective (RPO): the amount of data loss that a system can sustain, measured in time
   + MTD and RPO are used to determine which business functions are critical and to specify appropriate risk countermeasures.

## Prioritizing & Communicating Risk

+ Risk response strategies include risk mitigation (reducing exposure or effects of risk factors), risk avoidance (stopping risk-bearing activities), risk transference (assigning risk to a third party), and risk acceptance (choosing not to implement countermeasures due to cost or delay).
+ Factors to consider when selecting and prioritizing security controls include whether they are required by a framework or regulation, their cost, and the level of risk they mitigate.
+ The return on security investment (ROSI) is a percentage value that represents the reduction in loss created by a security control, calculated using the annual loss expectancy (ALE) before and after the control is implemented.
+ An engineering tradeoff occurs when a risk mitigation solution has its own risks or costs.
+ Risk communication should clearly articulate the cause and effect of risk scenarios and be presented in a manner that is appropriate for the organization's framework and jurisdiction.
+ A risk register is a document that shows the results of risk assessments in a clear format and should be shared among stakeholders.
+ An exception report is a document that records deviations from the risk management plan.

## Documenting and Training for Risk

+ Compensating controls are alternative controls that serve the same purpose as the recommended control and afford the same or better level of protection, but use a different methodology or technology
+ Ongoing monitoring is a key part of the risk management framework to detect new sources of risk or changed risk probabilities or impacts
+ Tabletop exercises are facilitator-led training events where staff practice responses to a particular risk scenario
+ Penetration testing (or "pen testing") involves actively trying to break through security controls to test their selection and configuration
+ The NIST Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment (SP 800-115) provides guidance on conducting penetration tests, which involve three principal activities: testing the object under assessment to discover vulnerabilities, examining the object to identify logical weaknesses, and interviewing personnel to gather information and probe attitudes toward and understanding of security
+ Red and blue (and white) team exercises involve teams of security personnel acting as adversaries and defenders in war game scenarios to test the security system's weaknesses
+ Vulnerability assessments involve identifying and evaluating vulnerabilities in a system or network, while threat assessments involve identifying and evaluating the likelihood and potential impact of threats to a system or network.
+ Risk assessments involve analyzing the potential impact of identified vulnerabilities and threats on a system or network, and determining the appropriate risk management strategies to mitigate or eliminate those risks.

## Applying Risk Management to Supply Chains

+ When relying on "off-the-shelf" products and services, organizations must take the vendor's statements about the security of their products at face value and implement their own measures to secure their working environment
+ Organizations with the ability to fully control their supply chains can establish a trusted computing environment to ensure the security and consistency of every element in the chain
+ There should be an onboarding process for new vendors, suppliers, and partners that includes due diligence to confirm that they meet minimum standards in various areas such as cybersecurity risk management, security controls for confidential data, and incident response
+ To ensure hardware source authenticity and the security of the supply chain, organizations should purchase from reputable suppliers and not from second-hand or aftermarket sources, and consider using accredited suppliers through programs such as the US Department of Defense's Trusted Foundry Program.

## Policies and Procedures

+ Digital forensics involves collecting and analyzing evidence from computer systems to a standard that will be accepted in a court of law
+ Digital forensics analysts, also known as forensic computer examiners or digital forensic examiners, may work for a variety of organizations including law enforcement, security services, banks, and cybersecurity teams in large organizations
+ They use specialized tools and investigative skills to recover information from computer systems and storage and may work with law enforcement to investigate cybercrimes or extract electronic evidence related to other crimes
+ Digital forensics procedures involve four general phases: identification, collection, analysis, and reporting
+ Forensics analysts should adhere to strong ethical principles such as impartiality, repeatability, and integrity when conducting their work
+ Work product retention refers to the way in which a forensic examiner is retained to investigate a case, which can be on a contingency basis (where the examiner is only paid if the case is successful) or on a time and materials basis (where the examiner is paid an hourly rate)
+ Policies and procedures are written guidelines that outline how an organization should handle certain tasks or situations, and they help ensure consistency, clarity, and compliance within the organization
+ Cybersecurity policies and procedures should be tailored to the specific needs and risks of an organization and should be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect

## Frameworks, Audits, and Policy

+ An enterprise security architecture (ESA) framework is a set of activities and objectives used to mitigate risks related to IT service delivery
+ A framework can shape company policies and provide checklists of procedures, activities, and technologies that should be in place
+ ESA frameworks can be prescriptive or risk-based, with the former requiring the organization to follow specific controls and being audited for compliance, and the latter being more flexible and adaptable to changing threats
+ Maturity models assess the development of an organization's security capabilities and guide risk management strategies
+ A risk-based framework focuses on identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks to an organization, and selecting controls based on those risks
+ Risk assessment involves identifying the assets, vulnerabilities, and threats to an organization, and evaluating the likelihood and impact of those threats
+ A security policy is a statement of the organization's position on security and the measures it will take to ensure it
+ A security procedure is a step-by-step guide on how to achieve a specific security objective or goal
+ An audit is a systematic and independent examination of the activities, records, and reports of an organization to determine whether they conform to standards and regulations
+ A security assessment is an evaluation of the security of an organization, system, or network, identifying vulnerabilities and recommending measures to address them.

##  IAM Policies and Procedures

+ Identity and access management (IAM) is the process of protecting how users and devices are represented in an organization, as well as how they are granted access to resources based on this representation.
+ IAM tasks include creating and deprovisioning accounts, managing accounts, auditing account activity, evaluating identity-based threats and vulnerabilities, and maintaining compliance with regulations.
+ Account management risks include rogue accounts, improper control of accounts, and attacks targeting employees for access to the network.
+ A password policy instructs users on best practice in choosing and maintaining passwords, while a credential management policy covers all authentication methods and alerts users to social engineering attacks.
+ System-enforced password policies can include requirements for password length and complexity, filtering of dictionary words, and history/aging.
+ Single Sign-On (SSO) allows users to access multiple systems with a single set of credentials, reducing the need for multiple passwords and improving convenience.
+ Identity and access management policies should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure they are effective and aligned with the organization's goals and needs.
