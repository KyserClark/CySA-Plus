# 5.0 Compliance and Assessment 

## Privacy vs. Security

+ Privacy is a data governance requirement that arises when collecting and processing personal data.
+ Security controls focus on the CIA attributes of the processing system, privacy requires policies to identify private data, ensure that storage, processing, and retention is compliant with relevant regulations, limit access to the private data to authorized persons only, and ensure the rights of data subjects to review and remove any information held about them are met.

+ Legal Requirements
   + Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)
   + Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)
   + Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)
   + General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
   + California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA)
   + The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
   + The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)


## Non-Technical Controls

+ Classification and Confidentiality
   + Data classification is a tag or label that shows how confidential it is. Data confidentiality can be divided into several levels, following military usage:
      + Unclassified (public)
      + Classified (private/internal use only/official use only)
      + Confidential (or restricted)
      + Secret
      + Top-Secret
  
+ Data Types and Privacy
   + Data can also be tagged as a particular type. The data type is important in terms of evaluating privacy as well as security requirements

+ Purpose Limitation
   + Privacy regulations such as GDPR stipulate that data can only be collected for a defined purpose, for which the data subject must give explicit consent. Data collected under that consent statement cannot then be used for any other purpose.

+ Data Minimization
   + Data minimization is the principle that data should only be processed and stored if that is necessary to perform the purpose for which it is collected.

+ Data Sovereignty
   + Data sovereignty refers to a jurisdiction preventing or restricting processing and storage from taking place on systems do not physically reside within that jurisdiction.

+ Retention Policies
   + A set of policies, procedures, and tools for managing the storage of persistent data.
   
+ Retention Standards
   + To meet compliance and e-discovery requirements, organizations may be legally bound to retain certain types of data for a specified period.
   
+ Ownership (Roles)
   + Data owner — A senior (executive) role with ultimate responsibility for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information asset.
   + Data steward — This role is primarily responsible for data quality.
   + Data custodian — This role handles managing the system on which the data assets are stored.
   + Privacy officer — This role is responsible for oversight of any PII/SPI/PHI assets managed by the company.

+ Data Sharing & Privacy Agreements
   + Non-disclosure agreement (NDA)
   + Interconnection security agreement (ISA) 
   + Service level agreement (SLA)
   + Data sharing and use agreement

## Technical Controls

+ Access controls are used to secure data and software resources, and can be applied to file systems, databases, and other types of resources
+ Access control lists (ACLs) contain a list of accounts (principals) allowed to access a resource and the permissions they have over it
+ Different policies can be applied to different statements (e.g. SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) in a database
+ Geographic access requirements can include data sovereignty considerations (e.g. where data is stored) and employee access from multiple locations
+ Encryption helps to mitigate the risk of access controls being circumvented or compromised
+ Data can be in different states: at rest (persistent storage media), in transit (transmitted over a network), or in use (volatile memory)
+ Data loss prevention (DLP) products help to discover, classify, and prevent unauthorized access to data
+ Identity and access management (IAM) involves managing the identities of users and granting them access to resources based on their roles
+ Logging and monitoring systems can help to track activity on a network or system, and alert administrators to potential security issues
+ Large datasets containing PII or PHI may be shared or sold between organizations, and steps can be taken to remove personal or identifying information from these datasets to reduce compliance risk when storing data
+ Deidentification methods can be used to remove personal data that is collected to perform a transaction but does not need to be retained afterward
+ Data masking involves substituting all or part of the contents of a field with a placeholder, such as "x", and is irreversible
+ Tokenization involves replacing all or part of the data in a field with a randomly generated token, which is stored with the original value on a separate server or vault and can be reversible
+ Aggregation/banding involves generalizing the data, such as substituting a specific age with a broader age band
+ Reidentification is the process of combining a deidentified dataset with other data sources to discover how secure the deidentification method used is
+ K-anonymous information is data that can be linked to 2 or more individuals and carries a risk of reidentification
+ Digital rights management (DRM) is a set of technologies that aim to prevent unauthorized distribution of content by requiring authorized devices or software to access it
+ Watermarking involves adding a hidden, identifying mark to a digital file to trace it back to its source if it is distributed without permission
