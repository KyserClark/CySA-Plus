# 5.0 Compliance and Assessment 

## Privacy vs. Security

+ Privacy is a data governance requirement that arises when collecting and processing personal data.
+ Security controls focus on the CIA attributes of the processing system, privacy requires policies to identify private data, ensure that storage, processing, and retention is compliant with relevant regulations, limit access to the private data to authorized persons only, and ensure the rights of data subjects to review and remove any information held about them are met.

+ Legal Requirements
   + Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)
   + Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)
   + Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)
   + General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
   + California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA)
   + The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
   + The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)


## Non-Technical Controls

+ Classification and Confidentiality
   + Data classification is a tag or label that shows how confidential it is. Data confidentiality can be divided into several levels, following military usage:
      + Unclassified (public)
      + Classified (private/internal use only/official use only)
      + Confidential (or restricted)
      + Secret
      + Top-Secret
  
+ Data Types and Privacy
   + Data can also be tagged as a particular type. The data type is important in terms of evaluating privacy as well as security requirements

+ Purpose Limitation
   + Privacy regulations such as GDPR stipulate that data can only be collected for a defined purpose, for which the data subject must give explicit consent. Data collected under that consent statement cannot then be used for any other purpose.

+ Data Minimization
   + Data minimization is the principle that data should only be processed and stored if that is necessary to perform the purpose for which it is collected.

+ Data Sovereignty
   + Data sovereignty refers to a jurisdiction preventing or restricting processing and storage from taking place on systems do not physically reside within that jurisdiction.
